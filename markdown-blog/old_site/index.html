    <p>Hello, and welcome to my website. It isn't completed yet, but I plan to have it done in June 2020. Currently I'm focusing on creating a functional and beautiful framework for future use from scratch rather than content.</p>

  	<p>After finishing my junior year at <a id="hl" href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/">Portland State</a> studying Computer Science, I realized that I still had no idea how to create or design a website. This site represents a personal project to get more familiar with basic web design and improve my understanding of how the internet functions from the ground up.</p>

    <p>While I originally intended to host this site from home using a <a id="hl" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/" >Raspberry Pi 3B</a>, it became clear that this wouldn't be an option for me without dealing with Comcast's <a id="hl" class="hyperlink" href="https://forums.businesshelp.comcast.com/t5/Domain-Names-Static-IP/getting-static-IP-address/m-p/40460/highlight/true#M3430" >expensive proprietary hardware</a>. That being said, because I still intend to do everything "the hard way," this website is currently being hosted on a VPS from <a id="hl" href="https://upcloud.com/" >UpCloud.com</a> using a <a id="hl" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mariadb-php-lemp-stack-on-debian-10" >LEMP</a> stack. While I could have easily used one of the countless <a id="hl" href="https://gohugo.io/" >javascript frameworks</a> meant to get a very pretty website up and running in just minutes, I instead decided to accept the challenge of doing things myself. That being said, I don't plan on a career in front end web development, but that doesn't mean I can't learn the basics on my own time.</p>

    <p>Thank you for stopping by.</p><br><br>
